(* This signature defines the lexical tokens for LIGO

   _Tokens_ are the abstract units which are used by the parser to
   build the abstract syntax tree (AST), in other words, the stream of
   tokens is the minimal model of the input program, carrying
   implicitly all its structure in a linear encoding, and nothing
   else, in particular, comments and whitespace are absent.

     A _lexeme_ is a specific character string (concrete
   representation) denoting a token (abstract representation). Tokens
   can be thought of as sets, and lexemes as elements of those sets --
   there is often an infinite number of lexemes, but a small number of
   tokens. (Think of identifiers as lexemes and one token.)

     The tokens are qualified here as being "lexical" because the
   parser generator Menhir expects to define them, in which context
   they are called "parsing tokens", and they are made to match each
   other. (This is an idiosyncratic terminology.)

     The type of the lexical tokens is the variant [t], also
   aliased to [token].

     The signature [S] exports an abstract type [token], so a lexer
   can be a functor over tokens. This enables to externalise
   version-dependent constraints in any module whose signature matches
   [S]. Generic functions to construct tokens are required.

     Note the predicate [is_eof], which caracterises the virtual token
   for end-of-file, because it requires special handling. Some of
   those functions may yield errors, which are defined as values of
   the type [int_err] etc. These errors can be better understood by
   reading the ocamllex specification for the lexer ([Lexer.mll]). *)

    (* Projections

       The difference between extracting the lexeme and a string from
       a token is that the latter is the textual representation of the
       OCaml value denoting the token (its abstract syntax), rather
       than its lexeme (concrete syntax). Note that [concrete] is used
       by the modukle [UnlexerGen] to transform the textual
       representation of a token (not a lexeme) into a lexeme. *)
