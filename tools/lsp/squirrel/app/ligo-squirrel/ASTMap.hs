---- Implementation notes:
----
--
-- We associate multiple timestamps with each value that has been
-- loaded or is being loaded currently, in particular:
--
-- * For every cached value we remember when the IO action that loaded it started.
-- * When was the last time each value got invalidated.
-- * If someone is currently loading/reloading a value, when they started.
--
-- This makes it possible to tell if the value is up to date and minimise the
-- number of actual loads, e.g. when the value is outdated, but we are already
-- loading it, so we can just wait for the result.
--
-- * A value is up to date iff its timestamp is > its last invalidation time.
-- * When a value is being loaded in another thread, it might be that when
--   that load finishes, the value will already by out of date, and we
--   can tell this by comparing the load strated time with last invalidation time.
-- * Having timestamps on values means we can guarantee that even if some thread
--   is slow, it will never replace the cache with an older value.

-- a newer version running, and if there is, it will return the same
-- result. So, if the currently cached result is outdated, this function
-- will provide something better, but it /might/ happen that what it

-- actions if there are already some running that are not too old.
