(* A preprocessing directive is made of an '#' followed by a
   predefined name.

   Line markers are one of such directive, which may carry some
   additional flags:

   of which 1 and 2 indicate, respectively, the start of a new file
   and the return from a file (after its inclusion has been
   processed). *)
