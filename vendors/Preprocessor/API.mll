(* Rules *)

(* The rule [scan] scans the input buffer for directives, strings,
   comments, blanks, new lines and end of file characters. As a
   result, either the matched input is copied to [stdout] or not,
   depending on the compilation directives. If not copied, new line
   characters are output.

   Scanning is triggered by the function call [scan env mode trace
   lexbuf], where [env] is the set of defined symbols (introduced by
   `#define'), [mode] specifies whether we are copying or skipping the
   input, and [trace] is the stack of conditional directives read so
   far.

   The first call is [scan {env=Env.empty; mode=Copy; trace=[];
   incl=[]}], meaning that we start with an empty environment, that
   copying the input is enabled by default, and that we are at the
   start of a line and no previous conditional directives have been
   read yet.

   When an "#if" is matched, the trace is extended by the call [extend
   lexbuf (If mode) trace], during the evaluation of which the
   syntactic validity of having encountered an "#if" is checked (for
   example, it would be invalid had an "#elif" been last read). Note
   that the current mode is stored in the trace with the current
   directive -- that mode may be later restored (see below for some
   examples). Moreover, the directive would be deemed invalid if its
   current position in the line (that is, its offset) were not
   preceeded by blanks or nothing, otherwise the rule [expr] is called
   to scan the boolean expression associated with the "#if": if it
   evaluates to [true], the result is [Copy], meaning that we may copy
   what follows, otherwise skip it -- the actual decision depending on
   the current mode. That new mode is used if we were in copy mode,
   and the offset is reset to the start of a new line (as we read a
   new line in [expr]); otherwise we were in skipping mode and the
   value of the conditional expression must be ignored (but not its
   syntax), and we continue skipping the input.

   When an "#else" is matched, the trace is extended with [Else], then
   the rest of the line is scanned with [skip_line]. If we were in
   copy mode, the new mode toggles to skipping mode; otherwise, the
   trace is searched for the last encountered "#if" of "#elif" and the
   associated mode is restored.

   The case "#elif" is the result of the fusion (in the technical
   sense) of the code for dealing with an "#else" followed by an
   "#if".

   When an "#endif" is matched, the trace is reduced, that is, all
   conditional directives are popped until an [If mode'] is found and
   [mode'] is restored as the current mode.

   Consider the following four cases, where the modes (Copy/Skip) are
   located between the lines:

                    Copy ----+                          Copy ----+

   brackets the mode saved for the #elif, which is sometimes restored
   later.

   Note how "#elif" indeed behaves like an "#else" followed by an
   "#if", and the mode stored with the data constructor [Elif]
   corresponds to the mode before the virtual "#if".

   Important note: Comments and strings are recognised as such only in
   copy mode, which is a different behaviour from the preprocessor of
   GNU GCC, which always does.
