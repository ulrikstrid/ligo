(* The API of the preprocessor

  This preprocessor recognised the following directives:

  "#define", "#elif", "#else", "#endif", "#endregion", "#error",
  "#if", "#include", "#region" and "#undef".

   Those are derived from the C# preprocessor.

   Note that unknown directives will be treated like plain text
   instead of raising an error.

   Strings and comments are only recognised in text areas that are to
   be copied. *)

(* Vendor dependencies *)

module Region = Simple_utils.Region

(* The source configuration gathers all the information about the
   input to be preprocessed. Comments can be chose from the following
   list:
      * "(*" and "*)" for blocks and "//" for lines;
      * "/*" and "*/" for blocks and "//" for lines;
      * "/*" and "*/" for blocks and "#" for lines;
   or any combination of the above. For other markers, you need to
   modify API.mll.

   If the field [input] is [None], then [stdin] is the input source.

   If the field [offsets] is [true], then error messages will include
   horizontal offsets (a la Emacs) instead of column numbers (a la
   Vim). *)
