(* Trace tutorial

    This module guides the reader through the writing of a simplified
    version of the trace monad [result], and the definition of a few
    operations that make it easier to work with [result].
*)

module Trace_tutorial = struct
  [@warning "-32"]
  (* The trace monad is fairly similar to the predefined [option]
     type. It is an instance of the predefined [Stdlib.result]
     type. *)

  type annotation = string
  type      error = string

  (* The type ['a result] is used by the trace monad to both model an
     expected value of type ['a] or the failure to obtain it, instead
     of working directly with ['a] values and handling separately
     errors, for example by means of exceptions. (See the type
     [('a,'b) Stdlib.result] of the OCaml system for a comparable
     approach to error handling.)

     The type ['a result] carries either a value of type ['a], with a
     list of annotations (information about past successful
     computations), or it is a list of errors accumulated so far.
     The former case is denoted by the data constructor [Ok], and the
     latter by [Error]. *)

  type nonrec 'a result = ('a * annotation list, error list) Stdlib.result
  (*
  = Ok of 'a * annotation list
  | Error of error list
  *)

  (* The function [divide_trace] shows the basic use of the trace
      monad. *)

  let divide_trace a b =
    if   b = 0
    then Error [Printf.sprintf "division by zero: %d/%d" a b]
    else Ok (a/b, [])

  (* The function [divide_three] shows that when composing two
     functions, if the first call fails, the error is propagated and
     the second call is not evaluated -- A pattern called
     "error-passing style". *)

  let divide_three a b c =
    match divide_trace a b with
      Ok (a_div_b , _) -> divide_trace a_div_b c
    |          errors  -> errors

  (* The function [divide_three_annot] shows that when composing two
     functions, if both calls are successful, the lists of
     annotations are appended. *)

  let divide_three_annot a b c =
    match divide_trace a b with
      Ok (a_div_b, annot1) -> (
        match divide_trace a_div_b c with
           Ok (a_div_b_div_c, annot2) ->
             Ok (a_div_b_div_c, annot2 @ annot1)
        | errors -> errors)
    | errors -> errors

  (* The systematic matching of the result of each call in a function
      composition is bulky, so we define a [bind] function which takes
      a function [f: 'a -> 'b result] and applies it to a current ['a
      result] (not ['a]).

        * If the current result is an error, then [bind]
          returns that same error without calling [f];

        * otherwise [bind] unwraps the [Ok] of the current result
          and calls [f] on it:
            * that call itself may return an error;
            * if not, [bind] combines the annotations and returns the
              last result. *)
  let bind (f: 'a -> 'b result) : 'a result -> 'b result =
    function
      Ok (x, annot) -> (
        match f x with
          Ok (x', annot') -> Ok (x', annot' @ annot)
        |          errors -> ignore annot; errors)
    | Error _ as e -> e

  (* The function [divide_three_bind] is equivalent to the verbose
     [divide_three] above, but makes use of [bind]. *)

  let divide_three_bind a b c =
    let maybe_a_div_b = divide_trace a b in
    let continuation a_div_b = divide_trace a_div_b c
    in bind continuation maybe_a_div_b

  (* The operator [(>>?)] is a redefinition of [bind] that makes the
     program shorter, at the cost of a slightly
     awkward reading because the two parameters are swapped. *)

  let (>>?) x f = bind f x

  (* The function [divide_three_bind_symbol] is equivalent to
     [divide_three_bind], but makes use of the operator [(>>?)]. *)

  let divide_three_bind_symbol a b c =
    let maybe_a_div_b = divide_trace a b in
    let continuation a_div_b = divide_trace a_div_b c in
    maybe_a_div_b >>? continuation

  (* The function [divide_three_bind_symbol'] is equivalent to
     [divide_three_bind_symbol], where the two temporary [let]
     definitions are inlined for a more compact reading. *)

  let divide_three_bind_symbol' a b c =
    divide_trace a b >>? (fun a_div_b -> divide_trace a_div_b c)

  (* This is now fairly legible, but chaining many such functions is
     not the usual way of writing code. We use the PPX extension to
     the OCaml compiler [ppx_let] to add some syntactic sugar.
     The extension framework PPX is enabled by adding the following
     lines inside the section [(library ...)] or [(executable ...)]
     of the [dune] file for the project that uses [ppx_let], like so:
     [(preprocess
        (pps simple-utils.ppx_let_generalized))]
     The extension [ppx_let] requires the module [Let_syntax] to be
     defined. *)

    module Open_on_rhs_bind = struct end
  end

  (* The function [divide_three_bind_ppx_let] is equivalent to the
     function [divide_three_bind_symbol']. The only difference is
     that the module [Open_on_rhs_bind] is implicitly opened around
     the expression on the righ-hand side of the [=] sign, namely
     [divide_trace a b]. *)

  let divide_three_bind_ppx_let a b c =
    let%bind a_div_b = divide_trace a b
    in divide_trace a_div_b c

  (** The function [divide_many_bind_ppx_let] shows how well this
      notation composes. *)

    let%bind x = divide_trace x e in
    let%bind x = divide_trace x f
    in Ok (x, [])

  (** The function [ok] is a shorthand for an [Ok] without
      annotations. *)

  let ok x = Ok (x, [])

  (* The function [map] lifts a regular ['a -> 'b] function on values to
      a function on results, of type ['a result -> 'b result].  *)

  (* The function [bind_list] turns a list of results of type [('a,
     'b) result list] into a result of list, of type [('a list, 'b)
     result], as follows.

        * If the list only contains [Ok] values, it strips the [Ok] of
          each element and returns that list wrapped with [Ok].}

        * Otherwise, one or more of the elements of the input list
          is [Error], then [bind_list] returns the first error in the
          list.

  (*  A major feature of [Trace] is that it enables having a stack of
      errors (that should act as a simplified stack frame), rather
      than a unique error. It is done by using the function
      [trace]. For instance, let's say that you have a function that
      can trigger two errors, and you want to pass their data along
      with an other error, what you would usually do is:
      [let foobarer ... = ... in
        let value =
          try get key map with
            Bad_key _ -> raise (Error ("bad key", key, map))
          | Missing_value _ -> raise (Error ("missing index", key, map))
        in ...]
      With [Trace], you would instead:
      [let foobarer ... = ... in
        let%bind value =
          trace (simple_error "error getting key") @@
          get key map
        in ...]
        And this will pass along the error triggered by [get key map]. *)

  let trace err = function
    Error e -> Error (err::e)
  | ok -> ok

  (* The real trace monad is very similar to the one that we have
      defined above. The main difference is that the errors and
      annotations are structured data (instead of plain strings) and
      are generated lazily. *)

(* Utilities to interact with other data-structure.  [bind_t] takes
   an ['a result t] and makes a ['a t result] out of it. It "lifts" the
   error out of the type.  The most common context is when mapping a
   given type. For instance, if you use a function that can fail in
   [List.map], you need to manage a whole list of results. Instead,
   you do [let%bind lst' = bind_list @@ List.map f lst], which will
   yield an ['a list].  [bind_map_t] is roughly syntactic sugar for
   [bind_t @@ T.map]. So that you can rewrite the previous example as
   [let%bind lst' = bind_map_list f lst].  Same thing with folds.
